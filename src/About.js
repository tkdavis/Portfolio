          {/* <h4 className="text-left">Hello, my name is Tyler.</h4>
          <p>I currently live in Henderson, NV</p>
          <p>I have 3 years of experience at a startup called <a href="https://www.boltthreads.com">Bolt Threads</a>.
             Those three years I worked on a laboratory information management system written with Ember.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, as well as many minor libraries like D3 and Oauth.</p>
          <p>I am proud of my ability to pick up just about any stringed musical instrument and play it.
             I am especially proficient in playing violin and guitar.
             In my free time I like rock climbing, designing video games, drinking tea, hiking, and reading sci-fi novels.</p> */}
